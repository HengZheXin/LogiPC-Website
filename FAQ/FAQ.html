              <summary>Question 1 : No Display At Boot</summary>
              <br><br>
              <p class="text">1. The motherboard does not respond and there is no display after plugging in expansion
                cardssuch as sound cards due to a problem with the motherboard expansion slot or expansion
               card.
               <br><br>
               2. The jumper-free motherboard sets the wrong CPU frequency in CMOS, which may also cause non-display failure. This can be solved by clearing CMOS. The jumper for clearing CMOS is
          usually near the lithium battery of the motherboard. Its default position is generally
          short-circuited at 1, 2, and the problem can be solved by changing it to short-circuiting
          at 2, 3 for a few seconds. To this jumper, just remove the battery, turn it off after the
          power-on display enters the CMOS setting, and the battery is up to achieve the purpose of
          CMOS discharge.
          <br><br>
          3. The motherboard cannot recognize the memory, the memory is damaged, or the memory is not matched can also cause the failure of no display when booting. Some old motherboards are more picky about memory. Once you plug in memory that the motherboard does not recognize, the motherboard will not start, and some motherboards will not even give you any fault prompts (tweets). Of course, sometimes in order to expand the memory to improve system performance, plugging in different brands and types of memory will also cause such failures. Therefore, you should pay more attention to it during maintenance.

              <summary> Question 2 : The computer crashes frequently, and it also crashes during CMOS settings</summary>
              <br><br>
              <p class="text">This type of failure is usually caused by a problem with the motherboard Cache or poor heat dissipation of the motherboard design. The author once found on the 815EP motherboard that the motherboard heat dissipation is not good enough to cause the failure. I touched the motherboard components around the CPU after the crash, and found that the temperature was very hot. After replacing the high-power fan, the crash failure was resolved. For faults with Cache problems, we can enter CMOS settings, and the problem can be solved smoothly after Cache is disabled. Of course, the speed will definitely be affected after Cache is disabled.</p>

              <summary> Question 3 : PC Crash</summary>
              <br><br>
              <p class="text">This type of failure is generally seen in the incompatibility between the motherboard and the graphics card or poor contact between the motherboard and the graphics card; the incompatibility between the graphics card and other expansion cards can also cause crashes.</p>

            <summary>Question 4 : The Screen color is not displayed properly</summary>
            <br><br>
            <p class="text">The following are possible reasons
                <br><br>
                1. Poor contact between the display card and the display signal line.
                <br><br>
                2. The display itself is faulty
                <br><br>
                3. The color is abnormal when running in some software, which is usually common in old-fashioned computers. There is an option to verify the color in the BIOS, just turn it on.
                <br><br>
                4. The graphics card is damaged.
                <br><br>
                5. The display is magnetized. This kind of phenomenon is generally caused by too close to an object with magnetic properties. After magnetization, it may also cause the display screen to deflect.
